# Step 1: Quality Control for RNA-seq Data
fastqc -o qc_reports/ *.fastq

# Step 2: Alignment of RNA-seq Reads
hisat2 -x reference_genome_index -U sample1.fastq,sample2.fastq -S aligned_reads.sam
samtools sort -o aligned_reads.bam aligned_reads.sam
samtools index aligned_reads.bam

# Step 3: Transcript Quantification
stringtie aligned_reads.bam -o transcripts.gtf

# Step 4: Quality Control for Hi-C Data
# QC for Hi-C data if available

# Step 5: Hi-C Data Processing and Analysis
# Process and analyze Hi-C data using Hi-C specific tools (e.g., HiC-Pro)

# Step 6: Integration of Hi-C and RNA-seq Data
# Integrate Hi-C and RNA-seq data using TCC-specific tools (e.g., TCC-GUI)

# Step 7: Differential Gene Expression Analysis
# Perform differential gene expression analysis using tools like DESeq2 or edgeR

# Step 8: Correlation Analysis between Chromatin Structure and Gene Expression
# Perform correlation analysis between Hi-C interaction frequencies and gene expression levels

# Step 9: Visualization and Interpretation
# Visualize and interpret the integrated TCC data to gain insights into the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression
